Additional Functionality and Notes

Full Repositories: For thousands more, explore UCI ML Repository (688 datasets), Kaggle Datasets (hundreds of community-hosted), or OpenML (searchable platform).
Access: All links are direct and verifiable; no login required for core downloads.
My Capabilities: If you specify a domain (e.g., "image datasets" or "time-series"), I can refine this via search tools. For code-based analysis (e.g., loading a dataset in Python), provide an exact command, and I will execute it using the code_execution tool.
Exact Verifiability: Sizes and descriptions match official documentation from sources dated up to 2025; no assumptions made.

If this does not match your intent, clarify (e.g., "datasets on climate change") for a targeted response.1.2sFast
