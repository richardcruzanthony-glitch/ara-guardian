# ara-guardian-main (scaffold)

This repository previously lacked a Node/TypeScript build. I scaffolded a
minimal TypeScript setup so you can run a basic build and verify the toolchain.

Quick start (PowerShell):

```powershell
cd c:\CProjectsmastra-bot\ara-guardian-main
npm install
npm run build
npm start
```

Notes:
- The scaffolded server listens on `PORT` (default `3000`).
- This is a minimal, non-invasive scaffold. If you have an existing
  `package.json` or a different build process, tell me and I will adapt.
